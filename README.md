Hello, World!

This is a side project I'm making while I'm in school, for my AAS-T in Software Development, which means that this project may not be updated frequently. If there are any issues, please submit them to [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/nshardy/Molecule/blob/main/issues), and if you want to create a pull request, you can find that [here](https://github.com/nshardy/Molecule/blob/main/pulls).
